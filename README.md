# RNN-LSTM-RvNN
This code is part of DL course project Assignment
## Assignment -4 
1. Develop any NLP Application (Hate speech, Fake news detection, sentiment analysis, etc) using Syntactic Parser as Tree Features. Using the following networks (deep learning library functions can be used) and compare the results using the metrics appropriate for the task like Accuracy, or F1 for classification and BLEU for translation.

a) Recurrent Neural Network  and Bi Directional Recurrent Neural Network

b) Long-Short Term Memory Network and Bi Directional Long-Short Term Memory Network 

2. Design a Recursive Neural Network and Bi Directional Recursive Neural Network on your own (deep learning library functions should NOT be used), for the task used in Q1 and compare its results to the networks used in Q1.
